# R2_MolecularDynamics

A dual-purpose molecular dynamics software

R2 is a C++11 simulation package that can be used to run atomistic simulations and perform complex analysis of the 
simulation trajectories in one place. 
R2 reads PDB and PSF files and the Charmm force field to run the simulations. It can also read the DCD trajectories 
produced by R2 or other simulation codes to analyze the simulation data.
